Blender Launcher is a standalone software client that provides with management of downloading and storing stable, daily and experimental builds of Blender 3D . It is a free open source project available for 64-bit Windows and Linux (GLIBC 2.27 and higher) operating systems. Why I need it? The goal of Blender Launcher is to make it easier to stay up to date with latest features and improvements of Blender 3D while feeling safe using a stable releases. Been a minimalistic portable application it is a nice tool for organizing and daily use of evolving free and open source 3D creation suite. What features it has? Compared to it predecessor Blender Launcher introduces number of major improvements: Rewritten from ground up code for better stability and extensibility All official builds are available: Stable releases Daily builds Experimental branches Faster starting times by caching data High DPI displays support Core features: Automatic checking of latest builds Fast access of favorite build via tray context menu or by middle click on tray icon Register .blend file extension for preferred build Startup arguments for launching Blender Template installation Indication of running builds and its number of instances How to start using it? Download latest version from releases page Follow Installation instructions and notes Use Blender Artists Community thread to ask questions and make proposals How to say thanks to a developer? The best reward is always feedback and a happy user face! Buy Blender Launcher on Gumroad for 4$ or more Thanx for using Blender Launcher!
