# Feature Request

## How to request a feature

Blender Launcher is relatively new project, so it is always nice to hear feedback and requests from Blender community about how to improve user experience. \
The best place to discuss proposals is a [Blender Artists Community thread](https://blenderartists.org/t/external-program-blender-version-manager-for-2-8) , however an issue template for [feature request](https://github.com/DotBow/Blender-Launcher/issues/new?assignees=DotBow&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=) is also available. \
To make things a bit more clear and predictable all main TODOs, proposals and issues can be found on [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/kWfu0FC7/blender-launcher).
